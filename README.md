# Real_Time_Physical_Activity_Detection
This project focuses on real-time physical activity detection using smartphone sensor data. By leveraging accelerometer and gyroscope readings, the system classifies activities such as walking, standing, sitting, and running. Machine learning models are trained and deployed on the dataset to achieve accurate activity recognition.
